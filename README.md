TODO:
	- growing plant collider not always properly working in game...but seperately completely fine. Problem with spawn and collisions?
	- sounds (add for moth: fly, attack and burn)

NOTE:
	- when "main.gd:78 @ spawn_random_at_markers(): Condition "!is_inside_tree()" is true. Returning: false" occurs set the AudioStreamPlayer of enemy before the VisibleOnScreenEnabler2D and set in the inspector Process -> Mode: Always
